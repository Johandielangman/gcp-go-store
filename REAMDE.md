# Google Cloud Storage

The Google Cloud Storage documentation for golang:
https://cloud.google.com/go/docs/reference/cloud.google.com/go/storage/latest


Installing the google cloud cli:
https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install
Run `uname -a` to see which one you need

Should now be able to run `gcloud --version`

For tests, we can implement a fake store:
